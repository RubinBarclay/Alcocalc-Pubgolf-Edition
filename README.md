# Alcocalc - Pubgolf Edition
This is a simplified version of a earlier project I made. I revamped it in order to use it for a round of [Pubgolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub_Golf) with my friends. It basically takes weight and gender into consideration and tells each contestant how much to drink in order for everyone to achieve the same blood alcohol content level (BAC).

Worth pointing out that this app is not responsive and is designed for desktop screens in portrait mode.
